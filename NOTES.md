Important implementation notes and tradeoffs:

- This implementation focuses on delivering a complete working system with robust fallbacks.
- Some production-grade features (e.g., password reset email flows, robust input validation, CSRF enforcement across all AJAX endpoints) should be extended depending on your deployment needs.
- PDF and Excel generation rely on optional packages. If they are not available the system uses graceful fallbacks (HTML/CSV).
- The multi-language implementation uses Flask-Babel; translation files (.po/.mo) should be added for full Arabic translations.
- For PostgreSQL/MySQL usage, set DATABASE_URL accordingly.
- Ensure SECRET_KEY is set to a strong value in production.
